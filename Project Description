Let a shop has the information of customers who are registered with them including their annual income.
The shop maintains a spend score (between 1-100) of customers based on their previsous purchases.
Now the shop wants to identify its customers in groups accroding to their annual income and spend score.
To do so, lets create clusters of customers. 
First, we need to plot the scatter plot of customers based on their annual income and spend score.
Now start making cluster of customers using K-Means Clustering.
Using "Elbow Method", find the nober of cluster (K).
After finding the appropriate value of K from the grapg plot, start fitting the clsuters. Use "K-means++" for initialization.
Now plot the clusters with their centroid and label each of the cluster. Use differenct colours for each of the cluster.
That's all.
